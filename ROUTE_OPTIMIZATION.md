# Route Optimization Improvements

## Current Optimization Changes

We've made the following improvements to the route optimization algorithm:

1. **Increased the span cost coefficient** from 1 to 100 to more strongly prioritize route optimization and minimize travel times between consecutive stops.

2. **Improved search parameters**:
   - Changed the first solution strategy from PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC to PATH_MOST_CONSTRAINED_ARC for a more thorough initial solution
   - Increased the time limit from 180 to 300 seconds for more thorough optimization
   - Increased solution limit from 300 to 500 to try more possible solutions
   - Added Guided Local Search parameters to intensify the local search for better routes
   - Enabled full propagation for more accurate constraint handling

3. **Enhanced distance estimation**:
   - Added a more sophisticated fallback algorithm when OSRM API is unavailable
   - Takes into account different road types and speeds based on distance
   - Adjusts for road network inefficiencies (roads aren't straight lines)
   - Adds time for departure/arrival logistics

## Using Google Maps API for Even Better Results

For even better route optimization, you can integrate Google Maps API which provides more accurate travel time estimates. We've provided a `google_maps_integration.py` module that you can use:

1. **Get a Google Maps API key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a project (or use an existing one)
   - Enable the Distance Matrix API
   - Create an API key
   - Set appropriate restrictions on the API key

2. **Configure the API key in your application**:
   - Create a configuration file or environment variable for your API key
   - Add the key to your application's configuration

3. **Use the Google Maps integration**:
   - Import the Google Maps integration module
   - Replace the OSRM travel time calculation with Google Maps
   - The rest of your application will work the same

Example code to integrate Google Maps:

```python
# In your main code:
from google_maps_integration import calculate_google_drive_times

# Set your API key
google_maps_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key

# Replace the OSRM call with Google Maps
travel_times_df = calculate_google_drive_times(station_data, google_maps_api_key, 
                                               progress_callback=update_progress)

# Then continue with your existing code
data = create_data_model(station_data, travel_times_df, hours=10)
solution, manager, routing = solve_route(data)
```

## Other Tips for Better Route Optimization

1. **Adjust the disjunction penalty**:
   - The current penalty is set to 5000 which is high, encouraging the inclusion of as many stops as possible
   - If you want to prioritize route efficiency over number of stops, you can reduce this value

2. **Set realistic time limits**:
   - Make sure the time limit (currently set to 10 hours) accurately reflects how much time your drivers have
   - Setting too short a time limit can result in many stops being skipped
   - Setting too long a time limit might create unrealistic routes

3. **Consider multiple vehicles/days**:
   - If your route is too long for a single day, consider splitting it into multiple days
   - The OR-Tools library supports multiple vehicles which could represent different days

4. **Pre-cluster stops**:
   - For very large datasets, consider pre-clustering stops by geographic region
   - Optimize routes within each cluster first, then combine them

5. **Adjust inspection times**:
   - Make sure the inspection times for each stop are accurate
   - Inaccurate inspection times can lead to unrealistic route plans
